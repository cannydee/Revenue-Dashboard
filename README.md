Revenue report dashboard for DLTM Retail

My first dashboard created using Microsoft Excel. The dataset used was gotten from the sales data of DLTM Retail which consists of the sales table, sales team, products and store locations each stored on separate sheets. I started by cleaning the data to make sure there were no outliers or duplicates. 

I derived the revenue by simple multiplication of order quantity and unit price, order cost by multiplication of the order quantity and unit cost and profit by subtraction of order cost from revenue for each of the products purchased.

I modeled the data also called data modeling and created relationships using the primary and foreign keys across each tables in the different sheets. I created pivot tables and charts to determine the top products; sales team and states by revenue.
I used the line chart to determine the revenue trend between January to May. I also added the product category slicer and timeline to make the dashboard report sliceable.

Finally I included a textbox to highlight my insights showing the top revenue products , the sales team which made the most revenue as well as the relationship between revenue, population and the median income of the states.
